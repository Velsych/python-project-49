**Hello on my first project(almost) on my own**

My name Alsy im learning python for 1-2.5 months and this my first learning task.

Brain games is simple chain of 4-5 grade class questions but u have only one life so be careful (・`ω´・)

First game in this list is "Even or no" game, u get absolutely random number and u must answer its even or no
3 times in a row, otherwise gameover.

Second game is calculation game, same rules, same punishment if lose ↑_(ΦwΦ)Ψ

Third game is very difficult game about finding common divide number, very complicated and scary, advice to use Euclidean method to find :P

Four game is very chill and simple u just need to continue progression ＼(￣▽￣)／
